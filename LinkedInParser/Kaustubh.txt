Like many academically inclined students of my generation, I pursed the IIT dream and studied at IIT Bombay. Was keen on doing research and was able to pursue that on a NASA grant at MIT while getting my M.S. That is where I discovered another passion, building things.In the late 90s I joined a tech startup after my MS and had a great ride in the dot com boom and bust and work in a place where I learnt a lot about building great tech products. Our team was able to take a product from $millions to 10x in revenue over 8 years. Eager to learn more about scaling and selling I joined one of the largest tech companies - Oracle and moved to California. During that time I learnt a lot about scaling tech businesses. Worked on acquisitions (including a very large one of over $1 billion), sales enablement, pricing, positioning and other strategy work to grow the data and analytics business.Enjoyed learning about marketing and selling SaaS at Stanford. Eventually the startup bug caught me and I joined a startup in San Francisco. I studied, worked and lived in the US for over 17 years.But, home was calling and I moved back to India to be closer to family and friends in 2014. Worked at a fast growing startup for couple of years to help scale their business, build a product and design team, achieve a SaaS transformation.It was during that time I realized that I not only loved learning and building, but also enjoyed coaching and helping others.That is how I started The ProdZen - a product and strategy consulting company (fka Nitrous Oxide).We have helped over 20 product startups in the last 4 years to create products from just an idea or improve existing products and scale the business.We also help IT Services companies with domain and technical expertise to create IP based solutions.Read more about us on https://www.theprodzen.com and DM me if you would would like to explore a collaboration.\n  \n\n", "experience": ["\n      The ProdZen\n ", "\n      NASSCOM\n ", "\n      ADVOTT MEDIA\n ", "\n      Manthan\n ", "\n      Birst\n "], "education": ["Massachusetts Institute of Technology", "Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay", "Stanford University"], "contact": ["\n        linkedin.com/in/kaustubh-patekar\n      ", "\n  theprodzen.com/\u00a0\n"], "phone_number": "No Phone Number", "posts": ["At the beginning of this month we at the The ProdZen took a small step.We started a product management internship program.Read the post below from Rahi Jobanputra as she shares what she is up to.We are also getting started with building a product manager community.If you are an aspiring product manager or simply curious, be sure to fill out the form.We are going to take your input and setup sessions to answer your questions.More details on this community will be shared in the coming days.Be part of something that could help build #india as a #product nation.", "To make customer understand the product, a product manager should understand the problem way before! Understanding the problem is the first step of building a product. Sometimes the problems are known and sometimes they are unspoken but known. After understanding the problem, the upcoming main stage is to understand the requirements, functionalities the product should have and the quality that is expected. Quality of the product is having a direct impact on customer satisfaction and success of the product. To answer the quality related questions, Non Functional Requirements are getting defined. It is a non negligible step and it is important for a product manager because it gives the quality assurance of any product/ service.This week at The ProdZen I worked on one of the most important steps of product development, Non Functional Requirements. It covered various non functional requirements, their definitions, characteristics, classification, why they are important, for what kind of product they should be there, way of implementing etc. Along with some general cases, I also got to work on some special requirements like country wise compliances. On some of the requirements, detailed analysis was getting done. With this, I got to know what importance they carry and how they are getting mapped to their kind of products and what proportion it carries while getting considered. On other side, I have been a part of an idea of building a product management community! Yes, a community that will help people by providing proper understanding of product management and solves the doubts regarding the same. The ProdZen  has taken the initiative to get interested people aware about product management. You are also having some doubts on the same right? You ask, we will answer!

It had evolved over the years and done well.Then some of the people came up with another product. It was for a business audience, but based on technology. Complex algorithms, data science, AI, ML and more.The techies in the team were really excited. My \"algo\" is better than yours.. \ud83d\ude04 Every presentation, marketing campaign, collateral, website was molded to that.It was all about tech, all about features, all about capabilities.And hardly anything about benefits.The market pushed back. Customers were not interested.Sales slowed down. Actually came to a stand still.Budgets were increased. More campaigns were run. Few leads came in, but hardly any conversions.Finally the techies relented. They had to accept that nobody cared about the algorithms. Well they didn't really admit it, but actually started talking about the benefits.Lead generation improved. Conversions came.Lot of waste.

It came to him as part of a re-org. He was an engineering manager, who had to layoff most of his team.That made him unhappy. \ud83d\ude0cThe product he took over was not doing so well.The team didn\u2019t believe in him.It looked like things were going to take a turn for the worse.Luckily, he had years of training as an engineer.And a few years as a developer. He had developed \u201cstrong\u201d analytical skills.He was good at problem solving.He started off by trying to find out why people did not like the product.And what they did not like about it.He talked to support team, sales team, training, consulting, customers. Everyone who was willing to share their side of the story.He promised all the people he had talked to that their concerns would be addressed.He gathered all the data, analyzed it and presented to his team and manager and their managers.He convinced  everyone to stop all new feature work and fix lot of the problems over 3-4 months.They called it the \u201cER release\u201dTo some it meant \u201centerprise readiness\u201d to others it meant \u201cemergency..\u201dFinally the release was shipped.First the support people liked it.Then customers started writing happy notes.Soon the pre sales and sales people were on board.The product impression had changed.Revenues started looking up.The team now believed in him.He was happy. \ud83d\ude00And then\u2026.he worked happily ever after.No, not forever, but another 6-7 years.True story?The ProdZen Rahul Ahmad Bhavish Sood Diptarup Chakraborti Manu Gupta Gayathri Krishna Rahi Jobanputra #productmanagement #leadership #training Yes, it is.Want to know how to become a \u201cstrong\u201d product manager? More in link", "How do you choose a direction when the ground is shifting?Is it even possible? How do you choose?If you are building products or work as a #productmanager, owner, leader, #founder you likely use a tool called \"product roadmap\".Just like a map tells you how to get where you want, a roadmap should tell the teams internal and external where you are headed.Unlike the world - which is now mostly mapped, the future of a product is not really known. Well, at least, its not predetermined.It is usually an exploration.Which means how you define the roadmap will have an outsized influence on the future of the product and likely your overall business.Along with execution, GTM strategy and market conditions including competition.Defining the product roadmap gets harder as the number of stakeholders and customers increase. It becomes an increasingly tough balancing act.Arguably one of the hardest balancing act is between Innovation and Improvement.Innovation is usually bold, requires R&D, investment and is not guaranteed. Its also hard because it is an exploration of its own.Improvement is usually incremental, addresses immediate and short term needs to customers and internal stakeholders.Improvement leads to short term wins and customer, partner and sales team satisfaction. It leads to predictable outcomes and usually has low to no risk of failure.Innovation can lead to creating new customer segments, growth and sometimes creating entire new categories. It can also lead to outsized outcomes, but also has a risk of failure.This is where the product manager's mettle gets tested.What do you think?How do you balance innovation and improvement? Do you allocate room for both in your roadmap?The ProdZenRahul Ahmad Bhavish Sood Manu Gupta Diptarup Chakraborti Rahi Jobanputra Gayathri KrishnaTo read more useful tips and discussions on product building and scaling, see link in comment.#productmanagement #strategy #innovation", "Sales is not a linear process.How do you truly and sincerely connect with your buyers and not just be a seller, but a true customer advocate and advisor?These and more such though provoking discussions were part of the concluding session of Firestarter cohort 1.Thank you Ravindra Chandrashekara for the sessions on Sales Strategy and applying design thinking to sales.Have not met such a sincere and optimistic #sales leader and trainer like you.Other gold nuggets from this session.*Put your audience at EASE-  Empathy - understand, put yourself in their shoes -  Authenticity- no faking, tall claims -  Similarity - common ground -  Experience - Shared experience* Explicit and implicit need analysis* Affliction and Aspiration* Emotional and Rational NeedsThank you Lavitha Pereira Vaz  and Navin Thangiah, Sharath Chandra for patiently listening, asking great questions and doing all the hard work.The ProdZenRahul Ahmad Bhavish Sood Diptarup Chakraborti Rahi Jobanputra Gayathri KrishnaTo learn more about Firestarter for #startups and #founders please check link in comment.", "What does a product roadmap have in common with an elephant?No, this is not the beginning of a PJ.It is something you can actually put to use.An elephant has  2 types of teeth- the external facing - tusks and the internal ones.The tusks are often big and add a certain pizazz.The internal ones are functional and do the grind.Literally. :-)#startups and #productmanagers can use the same idea when building a roadmap.There is an external facing roadmap that is used to work with external stakeholders - customers, partners, analysts, investors...There is an internal roadmap that is used to work with executives, development, sales, marketing, support. Sometimes you may use the external roadmap with external facing functions as well.The internal roadmap has near term items that are defined in great detail. It also have longer term items which could be still in R&D or simply exploration.External facing roadmap usually limits the details and often contains elements of innovation and vision, but usually comes with a disclaimer about changes in timelines. It also contains key announcements about upcoming capabilities that have strong demand.If you are a #founder you can use this to your advantage when pitching to early adopters or investors.The ProdZenRahul Ahmad Bhavish Sood Manu Gupta Diptarup Chakraborti Rahi Jobanputra Gayathri KrishnaWe will be talking about these and more such tools for product startups as part of our Firestarter program starting in July.More details in link.#productmanagement #strategy #growth", "What do you think, when you think of a #startup?Its hard work.Its ambition.Its difficult to succeed.Its creation.Its chaos.Is it possible to make things easier?Is it possible to turn the art into science?
